        <h1>My Blog</h1>

        This is my "blog."  Currently, it consists of two parts: a set of Explainers on 
        some mathematical things, and a book on measure theoretic probability I was working on at one point. Both  
        of these are personal projects. It's a way of forcing myself to explain a variety of things, hopefully to better 
        understand them. Sometimes it's because I'm learning something totally new; for example, I've recently become interested in physics.  
        Other times it's to revisit things I think I understand to try to "arrive at them" from scratch.
