        <h3>The Twin Paradox</h3>

        As a precursor to our discussion, consider spacetime with the standard metric:
        \[ ds^2 = c^2(dt)^2 - |d\boldsymbol{x}|^2 \]
        Just as we consider the lengths of curves in space, it is appropriate to consider the lengths of 
        curves in spacetime. To this end, let \(A,B\) be two 4-Positions, and we may consider the value of 
        \[ \int_A^B |ds| \]
        over all curves. Any given curve in spacetime can be parameterized by its proper time, which 
        constitutes a curve \(q(\tau)\). It will be natural to assume that any such curve is causal, in the sense that 
        \(q(\tau_2)\) is always in the future cone of \(q(\tau_1)\) whenever \(\tau \geq \tau_2\).  

        
        In the time of a particular reference frame, this can also be 
        written as \(q(t)\), and then:
        \[ \int_A^B |ds| = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \sqrt{c^2 - |\dot{q}(t)|^2}dt \hspace{0.5cm}  \]
        One can verify using the Euler-Lagrange equations that the action \(\mathcal L = \sqrt{c^2 - |\dot{q}(t)|^2}\) 
        is stationary when
        \[ 0 = \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\mathcal L}{d\dot{q}} = \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\dot{q}}{\sqrt{c^2 - |\dot{q}(t)|^2}} \]
        in other words, \(\dot{q}_i = C_i\sqrt{c^2 - |\dot{q}(t)|^2} \) for some constant \(C_i\) and each coordinate \(i \in \{1,2,3\}\).
        And thus 
        \[ \dot{q}_1^2 = C_1^2 c^2 - C_1^2|\dot{q}|^2 \]
        \[ \dot{q}_2^2 = C_2^2 c^2 - C_2^2|\dot{q}|^2 \]
        \[ \dot{q}_3^2 = C_3^2 c^2 - C_3^2|\dot{q}|^2 \]
        One can sum both sides of this equation to show that \(|\dot{q}|^2\) is necessarily constant. From which it follows that 
        each of the components are constant as well. We summarize with the following observation: the 
        <b>action is stationary if and only if acceleration is zero</b>.<br><br>

        The question remains of whether this is a maximum or minimum. By Cauchy-Schwarz, 
        \[ 
        \int_{t_1}^{t_2}  \sqrt{c^2 - |\dot{q}(t)|^2}dt \leq \bigg( \int_{t_1}^{t_2} (c^2 - |\dot{q}|^2) dt \bigg)^{1/2}(t_2 - t_1)^{1/2}  
        \]
        with equality when the integrand is constant (while this could have been used to begin with in the place of the E-L analysis, it does not 
        suffer from the hindsight bias). It therefore follows that the action is maximized for the curve of constant velocity. Do note that the 
        notion of constant velocity is Lorentz invariant. Moreover, among all possible curves \(Z(\tau)\), it happens to be the case that 
        \[ \int_A^B |ds| = \int_A^B d\tau \]
        so this arclength also describes the elapsed time on a clock moving along the trajectory \(Z\). And therefore, this elapsed time is also at a 
        minimum when the velocity is constant. From this we obtain the twin paradox: if two twins take separate paths through spacetime from \(A\) to \(B\), but 
        twin 1 moves at constant velocity whereas twin 2 moves at nonconstant velocity, then twin 1 will be older than twin 2 when they reconvene, because 
        the constant velocity maximizes the action.
