        <h2>Explainers</h2>
        
            If you are anything like me, you learn best by explaining to others. This is a forcing function to get me 
            to explain new material as I am learning it. I seriously doubt it will ever be of use to anybody. If it is, I 
            sincerely pity you. I do hope, however, that there is at least one redeeming feature of these explainers: I try to 
            avoid working backwards as much as I can. Many theorems are simple to prove once you know the conclusion. I have taken 
            at least <i>attempted</i> to get at the important ideas while pretending not to already know them. <br><br>

            Many of the sections are not hyperlinked. That is because they are not yet written, but I want them to be some day.
