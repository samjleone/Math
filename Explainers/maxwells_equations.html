        <h3>Background and Assumptions</h3>
        <h4>Current and Charge Density</h4>

        To understand the language of Maxwell's equations, it is necessary to discuss charge. At each point in space and time there is a charge density 
        \(\rho(\boldsymbol{x},t)\), so that \(\rho(\boldsymbol{x},t) dx\) is the approximate charge contained in a region \(dx\). Similarly, there is the notion of a 
        current density \(\boldsymbol{J}(\boldsymbol{x},t)\), which is a measure of how quickly current is flowing through a point at a given time. 
        Obviously, these two quantities are related. To account for this, we introduce the continuity equation 
        \[ -\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\rho = \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{J}, \]
        which says that the two ways of calculating the net change in current at a given time should be consistent with each other.
        As \(\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{J}\) measures the degree to which each point acts as a source of charge, it will be larger if charge 
        is generally leaving and negative when charge is generally flowing in. Hence, the negative sign is required.

        <h4>Maxwell's Equations as an Axiom</h4>

        Maxwell's Equations have a long history. The story begins with Coloumb's Law, an empirical law, which defines the forces acting in a static electric field. 
        The given form of Coloumb's Law necessarily implies what is known as Gauss's Law, the first of Maxwell's Equations. Then, the Biot-Savart Law 
        paves the way for magnetostatics, which in turn implies the second law. Faraday's Law is the third, and it relates a changing electric field to a magnetic field. The first three 
        equations are 
        \[ \begin{aligned} \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{E} &= \epsilon_0^{-1}\rho \\ 
         \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{B} &= 0\\
        \nabla \times \boldsymbol{E} &= - \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{B}}{\partial t} \end{aligned} \]
        In these equations, \(\epsilon_0\) is an independent physical constant called the permittivity of free space.
        These three equations may be regarded as completely independent empirical observations. 
        Moreover, they are true, even in the relativistic sense. What is not true is what was once known as Ampere's Equation: 
        \[ \nabla \times \boldsymbol{B} = \mu_0 \boldsymbol{J} \]
        The constant \(\mu_0\) is called vacuum magnetic permeability but is not independent, it is equal to \(\epsilon_0^{-1} c^{-2}\).
        But Ampere's equation contains a major flaw. It automatically implies that the current density, being the curl of something, has a gradient 
        of zero. This was corrected by Maxwell, whose Maxwell-Ampere equation is the fourth of the equations:
        \[ \nabla \times \boldsymbol{B} = \mu_0 \bigg(\boldsymbol{J} + \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{E}}{dt} \bigg) \]
        I have obviously omitted what the heck it is that \(\boldsymbol{E}, \boldsymbol{B}\) even do. 
        We shall take what is called the Lorentz Force law as a definition, which says that the force acting on a 
        particle of  charge \(q\), velocity \(\boldsymbol{v}\), and position \(\boldsymbol{x}\) is
        \[ \boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{v},\boldsymbol{x}) = q\bigg( \boldsymbol{E}(x) + \boldsymbol{v} \times \boldsymbol{B}(x) \bigg). \]
        At the cost of slapping history in the face, we will take all of this as an axiomatization: <b>Given the 
        physical definitions of charge and current density, the Lorentz force exists in the given form, and the fields which produce the Lorentz force 
        are related by Maxwell's Equations. Moreover, all of the original physical discoveries follow from Maxwell's Equations, and 
        so no strength is lost.
        </b> If we really wanted to, we could relax our axiomatization and simply insist that the five equations
        \[ \begin{aligned} \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{E} &= \epsilon_0^{-1}\rho \\ 
         \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{B} &= 0\\
        \nabla \times \boldsymbol{E} &= - \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{B}}{\partial t} \\ 
        \nabla \times \boldsymbol{B} &= \mu_0 \bigg(\boldsymbol{J} + \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{E}}{dt} \bigg) \\
        -\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\rho &= \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{J}
        \end{aligned} \]
        form a complete description of a system of partial differential equations, and that physicists are interested in this is 
        superfluous. However, it is important to make the kinematic connection for the sake of special relativity, which grounds itself 
        in unambiguous physical truth.

        <h3>Potentials</h3>
        <h4>The Scalar and Vector Potential</h4>
        The second of Maxwell's Equations says that \(\boldsymbol{B}\) is the curl of something, which we may denote by \(\boldsymbol{A}\). 
        And thus the third of Maxwell's Equations says that 
        \[ \nabla \times \bigg(\boldsymbol{E} +  \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\boldsymbol{A}\bigg) = 0, \]
        meaning that \(\boldsymbol{E} +  \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\boldsymbol{A}\) is the gradient of something, which 
        we may denote by \(-\Phi\). It is helpful also to note that
        \[ \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{E} = \nabla \cdot \bigg(- \nabla \Phi - \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{A}}{\partial t} \bigg) = -\Delta \Phi - \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{A} \]
        \[ \nabla \times \boldsymbol{B} = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{A}) - \Delta \boldsymbol{A} \]
        \[ \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{E}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial^2 A}{\partial t} = - \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \nabla \Phi \]
        
        And because \(\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{E} = -\Delta\Phi\), we may rewrite Maxwell's Equations as 
        \[ \begin{aligned} 
          \boldsymbol{B} &= \nabla \times \boldsymbol{A} \\
          \boldsymbol{E} + \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{A}}{\partial t} &= - \nabla \Phi \\ 
          -\Delta \Phi - \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{A} &= \epsilon_0^{-1}\rho \\ 
          \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 A}{\partial t}  - \Delta \boldsymbol{A} &= \mu_0 \boldsymbol{J} - \nabla  \bigg( \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{A} + \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}  \Phi \bigg)   \\
       -\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\rho &= \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{J}
       \end{aligned} \]
        The utility of these monstrosities will become more clear soon. 

       <h4>The Lorentz Gauge</h4>

       This does not seem like much an improvement. However, if we choose to kill the weird term in the Maxwell-Ampere equation by insisting that 
       \[ \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{A} + \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}  \Phi = 0 \]
       then it also follows that 
       \[ -\Delta \Phi - \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{A} = -\Delta \Phi - \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\bigg(-\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}  \Phi  \bigg) = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}  \Phi  - \Delta \Phi \]
        and so the resulting equations are 
        \[ \begin{aligned} 
        \bigg(\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}  - \Delta\bigg) \frac{1}{c} \Phi &= c\mu_0 \rho \\ 
        \bigg(\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}  - \Delta\bigg) \boldsymbol{A} &= \mu_0 \boldsymbol{J}  \\
        \boldsymbol{B} &= \nabla \times \boldsymbol{A} \\
        \boldsymbol{E} &= - \nabla \Phi - \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{A}}{\partial t} \\ 
     \end{aligned} \]
     In other words, the first two equations say that one can generate \(\boldsymbol{A},\Phi\) by solving the 
     inhomogeneous wave equation with sources \(\epsilon_0^{-1}\rho\) and \(\mu_0 \boldsymbol{J}\) and wave velocity \(c\).
     Then, after doing so, one can obtain the \( \boldsymbol{E}\) and \(\boldsymbol{B}\) fields "algorithmically" through the next two equations.<br><br> 

     An issue so far left unaddressed is the legality of the assumption that \(\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{A} + \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}  \Phi\) is zero. 
     Note that the validity of the analysis in the above section is unchanged under "gauge transformations"
     \[ \boldsymbol{A} \mapsto \boldsymbol{A} + \nabla \boldsymbol{U} \]
     For any function at all \(\boldsymbol{U}\). What this means is that if \(\boldsymbol{A}_0, \Phi_0\) are an original set of potentials, we could always design \(U\) to satisfy 
     \[ \nabla \cdot \nabla U + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{A}_0 + \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}  \Phi_0 = 0 \]
     Then we just need \(\boldsymbol{U}\) to solve the Poisson Equation 
     \[ \Delta \boldsymbol{U} = -\bigg( \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{A}_0 + \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}  \Phi_0\bigg), \]
     which is always possible. One such \(\boldsymbol{U}(x) \) is
     \[ \boldsymbol{U}(x) = -\int_{\mathbb R^3}\frac{\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{A}_0(x') + \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}  \Phi_0(x')}{4\pi|x-x'|} d^3x  \]

     <h3>Things that are Useful in Electricity</h3>

     <h4>Electromotive Force and Voltage</h4>
     If a particle of charge \(q\) follows a trajectory \(\boldsymbol{x}(t)\) from time \(t_1\) up until \(t_2\), the electromagnetic field will do the following work on it:
     \[
     \begin{aligned}
      \int \boldsymbol{F} \cdot d\boldsymbol{x} & = q \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \dot{\boldsymbol{x}} \cdot \boldsymbol{E}(x) + \underbrace{\dot{\boldsymbol{x}} \cdot \bigg( \dot{\boldsymbol{x}} \times \boldsymbol{B}(x)\bigg)}_{=0} dt \\ 
                                                & = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \dot{\boldsymbol{x}} \cdot \boldsymbol{E}(x)  dt
     \end{aligned}
     \]
     In the Lorentz gauge, 
     \[ \boldsymbol{E} = - \nabla \Phi - \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{A}}{\partial t}  \] 
     and therefore, \(\boldsymbol{E}\) is not conservative unless \(\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{A}}{\partial t}\) has zero curl. So we do not anticipate, in general, that 
     these work integrals are path independent. If we assume that the particle moves sufficiently quickly so that the fields are roughly constant over its journey from \(a\) to \(b\), then 
     \[ \int \boldsymbol{F} \cdot d\boldsymbol{x} =  - \int \nabla \Phi \cdot dx  - \int \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{A}}{\partial t} \cdot d\boldsymbol{x} = \bigg[\Phi(a)-\Phi(b)\bigg] - \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int \boldsymbol{A} \cdot d\boldsymbol{x} \]
     If we make the assumption that the magnetic field is slowly changing (or, better yet, that it is zero), then this integral is approximately equal to a potential difference \(\Phi(a)-\Phi(b)\). 
      This potential difference is called the voltage between \(a\) and \(b\). <br><br>

    We might imagine that the points \(a\) and \(b\) are two nodes of a battery. We could assume that the chemistry of it is such that 
    this voltage difference is independent of the path taken through the battery. In this case, the potential difference would be called the 
    electromotive force.
