        <h3>Phasor Analysis</h3>

        <h4>Motivation</h4>
        Recall the equations governing the relationships between the current through passive components and the voltage at its endpoints:
        \[ v(t) = R i(t) \text{ for a Resistor} \]
        \[ i(t) = C v'(t) \text{ for a Capacitor} \]
        \[ v(t) = L i'(t) \text{ for an Inductor}\]
        See <a href= '../passive_component_equations.html'>Equations of Passive Components</a> for derivations of these. 

        To illustrate how things can be hard, let's consider an example circuit. 
        Suppose for the sake of argument that we have a capacitor and an inductor in series, and that the voltage between the ends of this whole apparatus is 
        \(v(t)\). And we let 
        <ol>
            <li>\(v_C, v_I\) be the voltages across the capacitor and inductor</li>
            <li>\(i_C, i_I\) be the currents through the capacitor and inductor</li>
        </ol>
        To solve for the behavior of the circuit requires solving the following system of equations:
        \[ i_C(t) = i_I(t) \]
        \[ i_C(t) = C v_C'(t) \]
        \[ v_I(t) = L i_I'(t) \]
        \[ v_C(t) + v_I(t) = v(t) \]
        Using \(i = i_L = i_I\) for the common current, this can be simplified to solving:
        \[ i = Cv_C' \]
        \[ v_C = v-Li' = v - CL v_C'' \implies (1 + CL \frac{d^2}{dt^2}) v_C = v \]
        This is of course a second order differential equation. There are many ways to solve it, but 
        one reasonable way is using Fourier Transforms. If we assume that 
        \[ v(t) = \Re\bigg(\sum_{n \in \mathbb N} a_n e^{2\pi i n t}\bigg), v_C(t) = \Re\bigg(\sum_{n \in \mathbb N} b_n e^{2\pi i n t}\bigg) \]
        then the differential equation can if we take 
        \[ b_n = \frac{a_n}{1-CLn^2} \]

        <h4>Extending to the Imaginary Plane</h4>

        The previous analysis was all done assuming an arbitrary \(v(t)\). The reality is of course that 
        in AC, the voltage between two points typically takes the form of a sinusoid: 
        \[ v(t) = A \cos(2\pi \omega  (t + \phi)) = \Re\bigg( A e^{2\pi i \omega (t + \phi)} \bigg) \]
        which also immensely simplifies the Fourier Transform of \(v\). As is typical in Fourier analysis, differential operators 
        simply become algebraic ones. For instance, for the capacitor,
        \[ i(t) = Cv'(t) = - CA\sin(2\pi \omega (t + \phi)) = \Re\bigg( 2\pi i CA e^{2\pi i \omega (t + \phi )} \bigg) \]
        Hopefully, by now, the business of taking real parts has gotten old. It is much more convenient to work with complex functions and 
        have it be understood that you just take real parts when you want to get the "physical" quantity. So to this end, it's common to say that a 
        voltage is defined as the complex function 
        \[ v(t) = A e^{2\pi i \omega (t + \phi)} = A e^{2\pi i \omega \phi} e^{2\pi i \omega t}.  \]
   
        <h4>Defining Phasors</h4>
        <h5>Voltage and Current Across Passive Elements</h5>
        Suppose that we have a sinusoidal voltage and current of a common frequency:
        \[ v(t) = A_V e^{2\pi i \omega \phi_V} e^{2\pi i \omega t}  \]
        \[ i(t) = A_I e^{2\pi i \omega \phi_I} e^{2\pi i \omega t}  \]
        if we are describing the endpoints of a capacitor, it would then be the case that 
        \[   2\pi i \omega C A_V e^{2\pi i \omega \phi_V} e^{2\pi i \omega t} = C v'(t) = i(t) =  A_I e^{2\pi i \omega \phi_I} e^{2\pi i \omega t} \]
        or for an inductor that 
        \[ A_V e^{2\pi i \omega \phi_V} e^{2\pi i \omega t} = v(t) = L i'(t) = 2\pi i L A_I e^{2\pi i \omega \phi_I} e^{2\pi i \omega t} \]
        in all of these equations, we have \( e^{2\pi i \omega t}\) being multiplied by some fixed complex number. So dividing through, we can see that we could simply say that
        \[   2\pi i \omega C A_V  = A_I e^{2\pi i \omega \phi_I}  \]
        \[ A_V e^{2\pi i \omega \phi_V} = 2\pi i L A_I e^{2\pi i \omega \phi_I} \]
        The quantities \(A_V e^{2\pi i \omega \phi_V}\) and \(A_I e^{2\pi i \omega \phi_I}\) are called the \emph{phasor representations} of the signals \(v\) and \(i\). 
        They are complex numbers we could denote by \(V\) and \(I\). So then our final iteration of the resistor/ capacitor / inductor equations is
        \[ V = IR \]
        \[  V = \frac{1}{2\pi i \omega C} I \]
        \[  V = 2\pi i \omega L I \]
        Squinting, we see that these all look a whole lot like Ohm's Law, except now with complex numbers instead. In general, if 
        \(V = IZ\) for some \(Z\), then that \(Z\) is called the impedance. 
        In lieu of these, for AC circuit analysis, it is easiest to work with the phasors, which are purely algebraic. Once you've worked out what the phasors ought to be, you 
        can translate this back to "real life" using
        \[ v(t) = \Re\bigg( Ve^{2\pi i \omega t} \bigg) \]
        \[ i(t) = \Re\bigg( I e^{2\pi i \omega t} \bigg) \]
        <h5>Kirchhoff's Voltage and Current Law</h5>
        We will see that Kirchhoff's Laws continue to hold for phasors as well. For instance, if \(v_1, v_2 \ldots v_n\) describe (properly) oriented voltages across components that form 
        a closed loop, then 
        \[ \sum_{i=1}^n v_i(t) = 0 \]
        which implies for their corresponding phasors \(V_1 \ldots V_n\) that
        \[ 0 = \sum_{i=1}^n \Re\bigg(e^{2\pi i \omega t} V_i\bigg) = \Re\bigg(e^{2\pi i \omega t} \sum_{i=1}^n V_i \bigg)  \]
        For this to hold at all times, the sum inside is zero. (Think about it: if any rotation of a complex number has zero real part, then that complex number 
        must be zero to begin with.) A very similar analysis can be done for currents, which shows that KCL continues to hold as well. 

        <h3>Components in Series and in Parallel</h3>
        In DC, we have rules for computing the "effective resistance" from different ways of combining resistors. In AC, there are 
        very similar formulas. 
        <h4>Components in Series</h4>
        Suppose that we have two elements in series wth their respective impedances \(Z_1,Z_2\). If there is a total voltage \(V\) across the device, then we can split this into 
        \(V = V_1 + V_2\) across the two components. Moreover, there will be a common current phasor \(I\) flowing through the two components. Setting this up, we have the algebraic equations: 
        \[ V_1 = I_1 Z_1  \]
        \[ V_2 = I_2 Z_2  \]
        \[ I_1 = I_2 = I \]
        \[ V= V_1 + V_2 \]
        which implies the one equation
        \[ I = \frac{V_1}{Z_1} = \frac{V - V_1}{Z_2}  \]
        which is solved with 
        \[ V_1 = V \bigg( \frac{\frac{1}{Z_2}}{\frac{1}{Z_1} + \frac{1}{Z_2}}\bigg) \]
        \[ I = \frac{V_1}{Z_1} = V\bigg( \frac{\frac{1}{Z_2Z_1}}{\frac{1}{Z_1} + \frac{1}{Z_2}}\bigg)   \]
        or finally, 
        \[ V = I\bigg(\frac{\frac{1}{Z_1} + \frac{1}{Z_2}}{\frac{1}{Z_2Z_1}} \bigg) = I (Z_1 + Z_2) \]
        By induction, if we had \(n\) components in series, the corresponding impedance would be 
        \[ Z_1 + Z_2 \ldots Z_n \]
        <h4>Components in Parallel</h4>
        Suppose now we now have two components in parallel with impedances \(Z_1, Z_2\). We now have that both of these components 
        have a common voltage across it \(V\), and across each component 
        \[ V = I_1 Z_1 = I_2 Z_2 \]
        which means for the total currenet \(I\) that 
        \[ I = I_1 + I_2 = \frac{V}{Z_1} + \frac{V}{Z_2} = V\bigg(\frac{1}{Z_1} + \frac{1}{Z_2} \bigg) \]
        or finally, 
        \[ V = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{Z_1} + \frac{1}{Z_2}}I \]
        meaning that the final impedance is
        \[ Z = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{Z_1} + \frac{1}{Z_2}} \]
        it is not hard to see that, had we done this for \(n\) components instead, 
        \[ Z = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{Z_n}} \]
