        <h3>Flat Spacetime</h3>

        <h4>Metric Tensors, Generally</h4> 

        I've written a bit about metric tensors already. I introduced it in <a href = "curvilinear.html">Curvilinear Coordinate Systems and Operators</a> and touched on its tensor properties in <a href = "tensors.html">Tensors</a>.
        But to summarize, the metric tensor is the matrix \(g\) for which, 
        \[ g_{\alpha\beta}dx^\alpha dx^\beta = \begin{pmatrix} dx^1 \\ \ldots \\ dx^n \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} g_{11} & \ldots & g_{1n} \\  \ldots  & \ldots & \ldots \\  g_{n1} & \ldots & g_{nn} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} dx^1 \\ \ldots \\ dx^4 \end{pmatrix} \]
        yields the length of the infinitesimal with contravariant components \(dx^\alpha\). Note that this also means that, should we like, we could define the infinitesimal with covariant components 
        \[ dx_\beta = g_{\alpha\beta}dx^\alpha \]
        so that \(dx^\beta dx_\alpha\) also yields the infinitesimal length.

        <h4>Nice Linear Maps</h4>

        In particular, we might have two coordinate systems \(\{\boldsymbol{\alpha}_1 \ldots \boldsymbol{\alpha}_n\}\) and \(\{\boldsymbol{\beta}_1 \ldots \boldsymbol{\beta}_n\}\) related by a linear transformation: 
        \[ \boldsymbol{\beta}_b = T_b^a \boldsymbol{\alpha_a}  \]
        \[ \boldsymbol{\alpha}_a = (T^{-1})_a^b \boldsymbol{\beta}_b \]
        It is argued that the metric tensor, being a rank 2 covariant tensor, transforms as 
        \[ \begin{aligned} \tilde{g}_{\alpha\beta} & = g_{\lambda\mu} (T^{-1})_\alpha^{\mu}(T^{-1})_\beta^{\lambda} \\
           g_{\lambda\mu} & = \tilde{g}_{\alpha\beta}T_\mu^\alpha T_\lambda^\beta \end{aligned} \]
        It could be the case that we'd like the tensor in two different coordinate systems to both be equal to the same \(g\), i.e. \(\tilde{g} = g\). 
        One could spend a fair amount of time on what this implies for \(T\) as a matrix, but that is immaterial for our discussion now. 

        <h3>Spacetime, Physical Background</h3>
        In <a href = "special relativity.html">Special Relativity</a>, the spacetime interval is the same in every reference frame:
        \[ s^2 = c^2t^2 - (x^1)^2-(x^2)^2-(x^3)^2 \]
        In this equation, it is understood that the \(x\)'s and \(t\)'s are that of a "4-Position," i.e. it describes a time and a place.
        This is what it means for the speed of light to be constant, and for space to be isotropic, in every coordinate system. The spacetime interval can also be 
        represented as 
        \[ s^2 = g_{\alpha\beta} x^\alpha x^\beta \hspace{1cm} g = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & - 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \]
        The assumption of the invariance of the spacetime interval is the same as saying that the metric tensor is preserved under basis transformations. 
        The coordinate transformations \(T\) for which this is true constitute the so-called Lorentz group, and the transformations in the Lorentz group provide matrix 
        representations of Lorentz transforms.

        <h3>What is a 4-Vector?</h3>
        Circularly, you might say that a 4-Vector is something which transforms like a 4-Vector. Of course, any list of four numbers can be interpreted as a 4-Vector if we just 
        insist by definition that it follow the same transformation rule as a 4-Position. But the extent to which this list would represent anything meaningful is unclear. 
        So really, we'd reserve the term 4-Vector for any list of <b>physical objects</b> such that, was one to calculate the same physical quantity in a different reference frame, 
        these quantities are related via the same transformations as would apply to the 4-Positions. More concretely, suppose Frames 1 and 2 are related such that the 4-Positions are relate by 
        a Lorentz transform 
        \[ \begin{pmatrix} c\tilde{t} \\ \tilde{x}^1 \\ \tilde{x}^2 \\ \tilde{x}^3 \end{pmatrix} = T \begin{pmatrix} ct \\ x^1 \\ x^2 \\ x^3 \end{pmatrix}. \]
        Now suppose there are some four physical quantities such that when Person 1 measures it as \(\ell^0, \ell^1,\ell^2,\ell^3\) and Person 2 measures it as 
        \(\tilde{\ell}^0, \tilde{\ell}^1,\tilde{\ell}^2,\tilde{\ell}^3\). If it is the case that 
        \[ \begin{pmatrix} \tilde{\ell}^0 \\ \tilde{\ell}^1 \\ \tilde{\ell}^2 \\ \tilde{\ell}^3 \end{pmatrix} = T \begin{pmatrix} \ell^0 \\ \ell^1 \\ \ell^2 \\ \ell^3 \end{pmatrix}, \]
        and that this would work for any two frames, then the list comprises elements of a 4-Vector. Note that this does form a vector space, since this property is linear. 

        <h3>Differential Operators</h3>

        The main fact I'd like to establish is that, if two 4-Vectors solve the wave equation componentwise, then their transformed versions do as well. What I mean is that if 
        \[ \Box A = B \implies \Box A' = B' \]
        In our case, we shall have that \(A'(y) = T A(T^{-1})y\) at a point and likewise for \(B\). Thus, it would suffice to show that 
        \(\Box_y A(T^{-1}(y)) = B(T^{-1}(y))\). Indeed, 
        \[ 
        \begin{aligned} 
            \frac{\partial}{\partial \tilde{x}^\alpha}A'    & = \frac{\partial}{\partial \tilde{x}^\alpha} \bigg[T A(T^{-1}(y))\bigg]_{\gamma} \\ 
                & = \frac{\partial}{\partial \tilde{x}^\alpha} \sum_\beta  T_\beta^{\gamma} A_\beta(T^{-1}(y))\\ 
                & = \sum_\beta  T_\beta^{\gamma} \frac{\partial}{\partial \tilde{x}^\alpha} A_\beta(T^{-1}(y)) \\ 
                & = \sum_\beta \sum_{\mu}  T_\beta^{\gamma} (T^{-1})_\mu^{\alpha} \frac{\partial A_\beta}{\partial x^\mu}  \\ 
        \end{aligned}   \]
        For a second derivative,
        \[
        \begin{aligned} 
        \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \tilde{x}^\delta \tilde{x}^\alpha }A'  &  = \sum_\beta \sum_{\mu}  T_\beta^{\gamma} (T^{-1})_\mu^{\alpha} \frac{\partial}{\partial \tilde{x}^\delta} \frac{\partial A_\beta}{\partial x^\mu} \\ 
        &  = \sum_\beta \sum_{\mu} \sum_{\lambda}  T_\beta^{\gamma} (T^{-1})_\mu^{\alpha} (T^{-1})_\lambda^{\delta} \frac{\partial A^2_\beta}{\partial x^\mu x^\lambda}   \\ 
        \end{aligned} \]
        Summing over all \(\alpha,\delta\),
        \[
        \begin{aligned} 
            \Box A'^\gamma & = \sum_{\alpha} \sum_\beta \sum_{\mu} \sum_{\lambda} g_{\alpha \delta}  T_\beta^{\gamma} (T^{-1})_\mu^{\delta} (T^{-1})_\lambda^{\alpha} \frac{\partial A^2_\beta}{\partial x^\mu x^\lambda} \\ 
                    & =  \sum_\beta \sum_{\mu} \sum_{\lambda} \frac{\partial A^2_\beta}{\partial x^\mu x^\lambda}  T_\beta^{\gamma}  \sum_{\alpha \delta}  g_{\alpha \delta}  (T^{-1})_\mu^{\delta} (T^{-1})_\lambda^{\alpha} \\ 
                    & = \sum_\beta  T_\beta^{\gamma}  \sum_{\mu,\lambda} \frac{\partial A^2_\beta}{\partial x^\mu x^\lambda}  g_{\lambda \mu} \\ 
                    & = \sum_{\beta} T_\beta^{\gamma} \bigg[ \Box A \bigg]^{\beta} \\ 
                    & = B'^\gamma
        \end{aligned}
        \]
        So that is done!
