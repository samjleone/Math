        <h2>Power Flow Basics</h2>
        <h3>Using a Phasor Model</h3>

        In general, to solve the power flow problem requires solving a system of differential equations. We do not want to do this. 
        However, recall from <a href = 'phasors.html'>the phasors explainer</a> that it is possible to turn this problem into one of algebra via the use 
        of complex numbers. That is, we could associate each bus \(a\) with a voltage phasor \(v_a\). If two busses \(a,b\) are connected by a lumped 
        element (e.g. capacitor, resistor, inductor), then  there is a current phasor 
        \(i_{ab} \) representing the current flowing from \(a\) to \(b\). And these phasors are related via a generalized Ohm's Law:
        \[ v_a - v_b = z_{ab} i_{ab}, \]  
        where \(z_{ab}\) is the (frequency dependent) impedance of the element connecting \(a\) to \(b\). 

        <h3>Net Power Injections</h3>
        
        If a bus \(a\) has net current phasor \(i_{\text{net } a}\) out of the bus and has voltage phasor \(v_a\) relative to ground, then the power injection to ground is given by 
       \[ p_{\text{inj } a} = v_a i_{\text{net } a}^*. \]
        Here, the power injection is also a phasor as defined in the phasor explainer (using the RMS, not amplitude, convention). 
        Moreover, the current flowing into bus \(a\) is expressible as 
        \[ i_{\text{net } a} = \sum_{b \sim a} z_{ab}^{-1} (v_a - v_b), \]
        where we sum over all neighbors of \(b\) in the distribution topology.  Then we see
        \[ p_{\text{inj } a} = \sum_{b \sim a} v_a (z_{a,b}^{-1})^* (v_a - v_b)^*. \]
        This is a perfectly good equation. It is sometimes more common, however, to realize that there is a matrix \(Y\) for which  
        \[ i_{\text{net}} = Yv. \]
        In particular, for this to work, we'd select
        \[ 
            Y_{ab}  = \begin{cases} - z_{ab}^{-1} & a \neq b \\ \sum_{c \sim a}  z_{ac}^{-1} & \text{b = a} \end{cases}.
        \]
        This is essentially a complex-valued <a href = "laplacians.html">Laplacian matrix</a>. The corresponding weights are the admittances of the lines. If we also let \(V_a\) denote the RMS voltage of 
        each bus \(a\) and \(\theta_a\) the bus voltage angle, we then have 
        \[
        \begin{aligned}
        p_{\text{inj } a} & =  v_a \sum_{b} Y_{ab}^\star v_b^\star \\ 
                          & =  \sum_{b} V_a e^{i\theta_a} Y_{ab}^\star V_b e^{-i\theta_b} \\ 
                          & =  \sum_{b} V_a V_b Y_{ab}^\star e^{i(\theta_a - \theta_b)} \\ 
                          & = \sum_{b} V_a V_b \bigg( \Re[Y_{ab}] - i \Im[Y_{ab}] \bigg) \bigg( \cos(\theta_a - \theta_b) + i \sin(\theta_a - \theta_b) \bigg) \\
                          & = \sum_{b} V_a V_b  \bigg[ \Re[Y_{ab}] \cos(\theta_a - \theta_b) + \Im[Y_{ab}] \sin(\theta_a - \theta_b) \bigg]\\ 
                          & \hspace{0.35cm} + i \sum_{b} V_aV_b \bigg[ \Re[Y_{ab}]\sin(\theta_a - \theta_b)  - \Im[Y_{ab}]\cos(\theta_a - \theta_b)\bigg]   \\
        \end{aligned}
        \]
        The real part of this expression has got to be the real power, and the imaginary part has got to be the reactive power. If we represent 
        \( Y_{ab} = g_{ab} + ib_{ab} \), then one has 
        \[ \begin{aligned}
        p_{\text{real inj } a}  & = \sum_{b} V_a V_b  \bigg[ g_{ab} \cos(\theta_a - \theta_b) + b_{ab} \sin(\theta_a - \theta_b) \bigg]\\ 
        p_{\text{reactive inj } a}  & = \sum_{b} V_aV_b \bigg[ g_{ab} \sin(\theta_a - \theta_b)  - b_{ab} \cos(\theta_a - \theta_b)\bigg].  \\
        \end{aligned}
        \]
        In this decomposition, \(g_{ab}\) is sometimes called the conductance and \(b_{ab}\) the susceptance. These two equations constitute the so called 
        <i>power flow equations.</i> 

        <h3>Linear Algebraic Phrasings</h3>

        The study of power distribution lends itself well to linear algebra. The typical setup is to understand the distribution system as an undirected graph 
        \(G = (B,L)\), where \(B\) is the set of vertices / busses and \(L\) is the set of lines / edges; I have not written the more typical 
        \(G = (V,E)\) to avoid confusion with voltage.
