        <h3>Lagrangian Mechanics</h3>

        The fundamental premise of Lagrangian mechanics is that, among all the paths we could possibly conceive of, 
        the physical paths that actually happen minimize a certain kind of energy. Unlike Newtonian mechanics, in which one writes down 
        \(F = ma\) and solves the resulting differential equation, Lagrangian mecahnics considers the "first" and "last" state as fixed in time and space, 
        and then the in-between is thing that minimizes energy. <br>

        To the state of a system, we can define a function \(\mathcal L\) of its position, velocity, and the current time. This 
        function is called the Lagrangian. It has units of energy. Given an initial configuration \(a\) at time \(t_1\) and final configuration \(b\) at time \(t_2\), 
        the action function is defined as 
        \[ S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathcal L dt = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathcal L( q(t), \dot{q}(t), t)dt  \] 
        then Hamilton's principle says the following:<br><br>


        <div class = 'statement'>
            <b>Hamilton's Principle:</b> Paths of motion minimize \(S\), subject to their initial values.
        </div><br>

        Many texts will provide a Lagrangian, and then say that Hamilton's principle applies to that particular Lagrangian. And with a totally 
        arbitrary looking Lagrangian, we reproduce the laws of physics, and that is somehow a miracle! 
        To gain intuition for these Lagrangians, let's actually work in reverse: figure out the ramifications of these eqtremal approaches, 
        and then rectify them with known laws of physics.

        <h3>Strictly Mathematical Properties of the Lagrangian</h3>

        Let's begin with a mathematical discussion of Lagrangians and their associated action functional. The Lagrangian is a function of position and velocity 
        \(\mathcal L(q, \dot{q}, t)\). While it's natural to think of \(q = (q_1 \ldots q_d)\) as  Cartesian position and velocity, that's not necessary.

        <h4>The Euler-Lagrange Equations</h4>
        For simplicity, everything is going to be smooth. For a path \(q(t)\) of motion minimizing \(S\), it is of course necessary that 
        a perturbation of \(q\) of the form \(q(t) + \beta \xi(t)\) is suboptimal for minimizing \(S\), so long as \(\xi\) has \(\xi(t_1) = \xi(t_2) = 0\). 
        And since \(q\) is optimal, 
        \[ \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} S = 0. \]
        We make no assumption yet on the specific form of the Lagrangian, except that our action functional is defined from it. To be explicit mathematically, we will denote by 
        \[ \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial q} \]
        to be the gradient of \(\mathcal L\) with respect to its first argument, holding the second and third arguments fixed. We do the same for \(\dot{q}\) as well. Armed with this notation,
        \[ \begin{aligned} 0 & = \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} S \\ 
        & = \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathcal L(q + \beta \xi, \dot{q} + \beta \dot{\xi}, t)dt \\ 
        & =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} \mathcal L(q + \beta \xi, \dot{q} + \beta \dot{\xi}, t)dt & \text{ switching the order} \\ 
        & = \sum_{n=1}^d \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial q_n} \xi_n(t) + \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{q_n}} \dot{\xi_n}(t)& \text{ by the Chain rule} \\
        & = \sum_{n=1}^d \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial q_n} \xi_n(t) + \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{q_n}} \frac{d}{dt} \xi(t)  \\
        & = \sum_{n=1}^d \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial q_n} \xi_n(t) - \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \xi(t) \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{q_n}} & \text{ Integrating by Parts, using } \xi(t_1) = \xi(t_2) = 0  \\
        & = \sum_{n=1}^d \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \bigg(\frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial q_n} - \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{q_n}}\bigg) \xi(t)dt
        \end{aligned} \]
        and quite interestingly, this holds for arbitrary \(\xi\)! This can only be the case if the expression inside the integral is zero for all \(n\). This implies the Euler-Lagrange equation:
        \[ \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial q} - \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{q}} = 0 \]

        <h4> Noether's Theorem</h4>
        In the Euler-Lagrange equations, it could be the case that the Lagrangian doesn't depend on a specific \(q_n\) of \(q = (q_1 \ldots q_d)\). 
        A reasonable example are functions which depend on velocity, but not position (like kinetic energy, or momentum). This means that \(\frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial q}\) 
        is zero, and thus that 
        \[  \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{q_n}} = C_n \]
        for some constant \(C_n\). So to each "symmetry" (quantity on which the Lagrangian doesn't depend), there is a "conserved quantity" in time. 
        This is the simplest statement of Noether's Theorem, although fancier generalizations do exist. The conserved quantity \(\frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{q_n}}\) is 
        called a generalized momentum. <br><br>
        <h4>"Energy" Conservation</h4>
        The total derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to time is 
        \[ 
        \begin{aligned}
        \frac{d}{dt}\mathcal L & = \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial q} \cdot \dot{q} + \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{q}} \cdot \ddot{q} + \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial t} & \text{ by the chain rule} \\ 
                               & = \bigg(\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{q}}\bigg) \cdot \dot{q} + \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{q}} \cdot \ddot{q} + \frac{\partial\mathcal  L}{\partial t} & \text{ by Euler-Lagrange} \\
                               & = \frac{d}{dt}\bigg( \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{q}} \cdot \dot{q} \bigg)  + \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial t}
        \end{aligned}
        \]
        implying 
        \[ \frac{d}{dt}\bigg(  \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{q}} \cdot \dot{q} - \mathcal L \bigg) = -  \frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial t}.  \]
        It is thus very interesting for when the Lagrangian does not depend on time (in the non-total sense that \(\frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial t} = 0\)), as this means 
        \[ E \triangleq \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{q}} \cdot \dot{q} - \mathcal L\]
        is unchanging as time goes on. It is possible to unify this observation with the prior one, which I may save for a later version of 
        this explainer.

        <h4>Separable Lagrangians</h4>
        Suppose further that the Lagrangian can be separated like \( \mathcal L = T(\dot{q}) - V(q).\) In this case, the Euler Lagrange equations 
        imply that 
        \[ \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}} = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial q} \]
        This observation will be of greater interest later.

        <h3>Hamiltonians and Hamilton's Dynamics</h3>

        Recall that we showed 
        \[ \mathcal E \triangleq \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{q}} \cdot \dot{q} - \mathcal L \]
        is conserved in time. This required the Euler-Lagrange equations to work, so this statement is limited to 
        the path of a particle whose action is at an extremum (i.e. paths of actul particles). It is also limited to the situation in 
        which the Lagrangian doesn't depend on time explicitly. It is natural to wonder: even if things aren't conserved, are there useful relationships between \(\mathcal E\) and the Lagrangian? 
        The answer is: yes. First, we continue to define the canonical momentum as 
        \[ p_i = \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} \]
        even if it's not conserved. We then define the Hamiltonian as
        \[ \mathcal H(\boldsymbol{p}, \boldsymbol{q},t) = \boldsymbol{p} \cdot \boldsymbol{\dot{q}} - \mathcal L(\boldsymbol{q}, \boldsymbol{\dot{q}},t) \]
        so that 
        \[ \mathcal H\bigg(\frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{\boldsymbol{q}}} , \boldsymbol{q},t\bigg) =   \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{\boldsymbol{q}}}\cdot \boldsymbol{\dot{q}} - \mathcal L(\boldsymbol{q}, \boldsymbol{\dot{q}},t) = \mathcal E \]
        in this sense, we defined the Hamiltonian as something more general than the conserved energy. Purely by definition, the Hamiltonian satisfies
        \[ 
        \begin{aligned} 
        \frac{\mathcal {\partial H}}{\partial \boldsymbol{p}} & = \dot{\boldsymbol{q}} \\ 
        \frac{\mathcal {\partial H}}{\partial \boldsymbol{q}} & = - \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \boldsymbol{q}}\\ 
        \end{aligned}
        \]
        However, if we restrict our attention to "good paths," the Euler Lagrange equation is satisfied: 
        \[ \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \boldsymbol{q}} = \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \boldsymbol{\dot{q}}} = \frac{d \boldsymbol{p}}{dt}. \]
        To summarize, the paths of "good particles" should obey Hamilton's dynamics: 
        \[ \begin{aligned} 
        \frac{\mathcal {\partial H}}{\partial \boldsymbol{p}} & = \frac{\boldsymbol{d\boldsymbol{q}}}{dt} \\ 
        - \frac{\mathcal {\partial H}}{\partial \boldsymbol{q}} & = \frac{d \boldsymbol{p}}{dt} \\ 
        \end{aligned} \]
        Note that Hamilton's dynamics allow for the case that the Lagrangian depends on time.<br><br> 

        By construction, any particle obeying the principle of least action should evolve according to Hamilton's dynamics. 
        What of the converse? If we knew about Hamilton's dynamics, it would be natural to "define" the Lagrangian as: 
        \[ \mathcal L(\boldsymbol{q}, \boldsymbol{\dot{q}}, \boldsymbol{p}) \triangleq \boldsymbol{p} \cdot \boldsymbol{\dot{q}} -  \mathcal H(\boldsymbol{q}, \boldsymbol{p}) \]
        Hamilton's dynamics then imply 
        \[ \begin{aligned} 
        \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \boldsymbol{\dot{q}}} & = \boldsymbol{p} \\
         \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \boldsymbol{q}} & = \frac{\partial \mathcal H}{\partial \boldsymbol{q}} =  \frac{d \boldsymbol{p}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\bigg(\frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \boldsymbol{\dot{q}}} \bigg)
         \end{aligned} \]
        And therefore, Hamilton's dynamics imply the Euler-Lagrange equations, which in turn imply least action.

        <h4>The Hamilton-Jacobi Equation</h4> 

        Suppose that a particle is obeying a trajectory \(\boldsymbol{q}(t)\) such that the principle of least 
        action always holds. As usual, we shall hold the starting and ending locations \(\boldsymbol{q}_i, \boldsymbol{q}_f\) fixed. 
        In one scenario, we might allow the particle to travel from start to finish over an interval \([t_i,t_f]\). If we 
        allow this interval to grow to \([t_i, t_f + h] \), then the least action could change. The particle now takes a new path 
        \[ \boldsymbol{q}_{\text{New}}(t ; h) = \boldsymbol{q}(t) + \xi(t, h). \]
        Where we define \(\boldsymbol{q}(t) = \boldsymbol{q}(t_f)\) for \(t > t_f\), just so that we have something defined for more time. And now,
        \[ 
        \begin{aligned}
            \frac{d}{dh} \int_{t_i}^{t_f + h} \mathcal L dt & = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} \mathcal L(\boldsymbol{q} + \xi, \dot{\boldsymbol{q}} + \dot{\xi}, t) dt + \frac{d}{dh} \int_{t_f}^{t_f +  h} \mathcal L dt \\ 
                                                      & = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \boldsymbol{q}} \cdot \frac{d \xi(t)}{dh} + \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{\boldsymbol{q}}} \cdot \frac{d \dot{\xi}(t)}{dh} dt + \frac{d}{dh}\int_{t_f}^{t_f +  h} \mathcal L dt \\ 
                                                      & = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} \frac{d\xi}{dh} \cdot \bigg(\frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \boldsymbol{q}}  - \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{\boldsymbol{q}}} \bigg) dt + \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{\boldsymbol{q}}} \cdot \frac{d\xi}{dh} \rvert_{t_i}^{t_f} + \frac{d}{dh}\int_{t_f}^{t_f +  h} \mathcal L dt \\ 
                                                      & = 0 + \bigg(\frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{\boldsymbol{q}}} \cdot \frac{d\xi}{dh}\bigg)(t_f) 
        \end{aligned}
        \]
        By the chain rule and integration by parts,
        \[  \frac{d}{dh}\int_{t_f}^{t_f +  h} \mathcal L dt = 0 + \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{\boldsymbol{q}}} \cdot \frac{d\xi}{dh} \rvert_{t_f}^{t_f + h} + \mathcal L(\boldsymbol{q}_{\text{New}}, \dot{\boldsymbol{q}_{\text{New}}}, t)  \] 
        Thus, evaluating the derivative at \(h = 0\),
        \[\begin{aligned} \frac{d}{dh}S & =  \mathcal L + \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{\boldsymbol{q}}} \cdot \frac{d\xi}{dh} \rvert_{t_i}^{t_f} \\ 
                                        & = \mathcal L + \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{\boldsymbol{q}}} \cdot \frac{d}{dh} \big( \boldsymbol{q}_{\text{New}} - \boldsymbol{q} \big)\rvert_{t_i}^{t_f}  \\ 
                                        \end{aligned}
        \]
        At \(t_f\), we have that \(\xi(t_f,h) = \boldsymbol{q}_f - \boldsymbol{q}_{\text{New}}(t_f,h)\). Thus, the derivative with respect to \(h\) is 
        \( - \frac{d}{dh}\boldsymbol{q}_{\text{New}}\). If we assume that the shape of \(\boldsymbol{q}\) does not change 
        drastically, then this should be the same as \(-\dot{\boldsymbol{q}}(t_f)\). Plugging this in, we have 
        \[ \frac{dS}{dt} = \mathcal L - \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{\boldsymbol{q}}} \cdot \dot{\boldsymbol{q}} = - \mathcal H \]

        Wikipedia offers a more simple (and different looking) version of the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation. The idea is as follows: we may consider the minimal action 
        \(S\) to be a function of \(\boldsymbol{q}_i, \boldsymbol{q}_f, t_i, t_f\). Moreover, by the definition of the action 
        \[ \frac{d}{dt}S = \mathcal L \]
        On the other hand, if we have some curve in mind described by \(\boldsymbol{q}(t)\), we can let 
        \(\boldsymbol{q}_f = \boldsymbol{q}(t)\). In which case, we have 
        \[ \frac{d}{dt}S = \frac{\partial S}{\partial \boldsymbol{q}_f} \cdot \dot{q} + \frac{\partial S}{\partial t} \]
        Equating these and recalling that \(\mathcal H = \boldsymbol{p} \cdot \dot{\boldsymbol{q}} - \mathcal L\),
        \[ \begin{aligned}  \frac{\partial S}{\partial t} = - \bigg( \frac{\partial S}{\partial \boldsymbol{q}_f} \cdot \dot{q} - \mathcal L\bigg)  = \mathcal H\big( \boldsymbol{q}, \frac{\partial S}{\partial \boldsymbol{q}_f}, t \big), \end{aligned} \] 
        which is the so called Hamilton Jacobi equation. 

        <h3>Lagrangians in Physics</h3>

        <h4>Motivating Example: Conservative Forces</h4>
        Consider once more the equation for a separable Lagrangian:
        \[ \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}} = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial q} \]
        and compare this to the force due to a conservative force:
        \[ \frac{d}{dt} p = -\nabla V \]
        where \(V\) is the scalar potential. A sensible thing to do would be to construct 
        \(\mathcal L = T - V \) so that \(\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}} = p = m\dot{x} =  \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial x}\).
        And then we would just take \(V\) to be scalar potential energy. A solution to 
        \[ \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}} = m \dot{x} \]
        is for \(T = \frac{1}{2}m |\dot{v}|^2\). This is, of course, the kinetic energy. Therefore, in such a case, 
        the choice of \(\mathcal L = T - V \) is a good Lagrangian. And in the presence of conservative forces, 
        the principle of stationary action applies. Moreover, the four fundamental forces are all conservative ones, 
        so this is a powerful statement.

        <h4>Energy Conservation</h4>
        We argued that for a Lagrangian that doesn't depend on time, the following quantity is conserved:
        \[ E \triangleq \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{q}} \cdot \dot{q} - \mathcal L\]
        Letting \(\mathcal L = T-V\) be our specified Lagrangian, this means that 
        \[ E = \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}} \cdot \dot{q} - (T-V) = m \dot{q} \cdot \dot{q} - T + V = 2T - T + V = T + V \]
        is always conserved. This is the conservation of energy. It is worth noting that 
        the main reason this worked is because \(\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}} \cdot \dot{q} = 2T\).  <br><br>

        <h4>What was Important?</h4>
        Let's reflect on what we found, and what was needed:
        <ol>
            <li>Assuming Newton's laws for a conservative force, we were able to prove that motions follow the principle of 
                stationary action with the Lagrangian \(T-V\).
            </li>
            <li>
                Given the specific form of \(V = \frac{1}{2}m|\dot{q}|^2\), we could prove the conservation of energy.
            </li>
        </ol>
        In my mind, the question remains: which of these are necessary? Is there another order? 

        <h3>The Following are Equivalent</h3>

        For this section, we'll pretend like all forces are conservative (they aren't).

        Consider the following laws of physics with a fixed notion of kinetic energy \(T = \frac{1}{2}m|\dot{q}|^2\):
        \[ \begin{aligned} A: & \hspace{0.25cm} m \ddot{q} = - \nabla V, \text{ for some } V. \\
          B: & \hspace{0.25cm} \text{The principle of stationary action holds with } \mathcal L =  T(\dot{q}) - V(q), \text{ for some } V. \\
          C: & \hspace{0.25cm} T(\dot{q}) + V(q) \text{ is constant, for some } V.  \end{aligned} \]
        We were able to deduce that \(A \implies B \implies C\). In particular, we showed that Newton's second law implies 
        that \(V\) is the "right" function for conservation of energy. <br><br>
        
        Note that if \(C \implies A\) directly, then the three would all be logically equivalent. Indeed, \(C\) implies that 
        \[ \frac{d}{dt} T(\dot{q}(t)) = - \frac{d}{dt} V(q(t))  \]
        \[ m\dot{q} \cdot \ddot{q} = - \nabla V \cdot \dot{q} \]
        and as \(\dot{q}\) is arbitrary in this expression, it must be that \(m \ddot{q} = - \nabla V \), which is \(A\).
        To summarize, this analysis has been interesting, but not coincidental! In particular, \(C \implies B \implies A\). 
        In plain English, the conservation of energy implies Newton's second law, which is basically just the Euler-Lagrange equation 
        for the Lagrangian \(\mathcal L = T-V\). 
    
        <h4>Non-Conservative Forces</h4>
        The Lagrangian for conservative forces is is just \(\mathcal L = T - V\).  The story is different for non-conservative forces. 
        We shall pick on the electromagnetic force in this section. <br><br>

        The Euler-Lagrange equations say that, 
        \[ \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{\boldsymbol{x}}} = \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \boldsymbol{x}} \]
        It is reasonable to ask: is it possible to map this directly to any electromagnetic phenomenon? Well, we already know that 
        \[ \begin{aligned} 
        m \ddot{x} & = q\bigg(-\nabla \Phi - \frac{\partial A}{\partial t} + \dot{x} \times \nabla \times A \bigg) \\
       &  = q\bigg(-\nabla \Phi - \frac{\partial A}{\partial t} + \nabla(\dot{x} \cdot  A) - (\dot{x} \cdot \nabla)A \bigg) \end{aligned} \]
       Using for the total derivative of the vector potential
       \[ \frac{d}{dt} A = \frac{\partial A}{\partial t} + (\dot{x} \cdot \nabla) A, \]
        The Lorentz Force law rearranges to
        \[ \frac{d}{dt}\bigg( m \dot{x} + q A \bigg) = q\bigg( -\nabla \Phi +  \nabla(\dot{x} \cdot  A)  \bigg)  \]
        Therefore, it's reasonable to seek a Lagrangian for which 
        \[ \begin{aligned} \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot{\boldsymbol{x}}} & = m \dot{x} + q A \\ 
           \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial x} & = q\big( -\nabla \Phi +  \nabla(\dot{x} \cdot  A) \big) \end{aligned} \]
        To get the first equation to work, you'd imagine that 
        \[ \mathcal L = m \dot{x} \cdot \dot{x} + q A \cdot \dot{x} + \text{Something}(x)  \]
        If you take the \(x\) derivative, it thus follows that 
        \[ q \nabla (A \cdot \dot{x}) + \nabla \text{Something} = - q \nabla \Phi +  q\nabla(\dot{x} \cdot  A)  \]
        \[ \nabla \text{Something} = - q \nabla \Phi  \]
        \[ \text{Something} = -q\Phi \]
        Which leads us to the correct guess for the electromagnetic Lagrangian in SI units:
        \[ \mathcal L =  m \dot{\boldsymbol{x}} \cdot \dot{\boldsymbol{x}} + q \boldsymbol{A} \cdot \dot{\boldsymbol{x}} - q \Phi \]
        Note also that, 
        \[ q \boldsymbol{A} \cdot \dot{\boldsymbol{x}} - q \Phi  = q(\frac{\Phi}{c}, \boldsymbol{A}) \cdot ()\]
