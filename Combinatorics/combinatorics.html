        <div class = 'theorem'>
            <div class = 'name'>
                Binomial Fact 1.
            </div>
            <div class = 'statement'>
                The following holds for all \(0 \leq k \leq n\):
                \[ \binom{n}{k}\bigg(\frac{1}{4}\bigg)^{k} \bigg(\frac{3}{4}\bigg)^{n-k} = \sum_{m=k}^{n} \binom{n}{m} \binom{m}{k} \bigg(\frac{1}{2}\bigg)^{n} \bigg(\frac{1}{2}\bigg)^{m} \]
            </div>
            <div class = 'proof'>
                Proof:<br><br>

                Note first that, multiplying both sides of the above by \(4^n\), this is algebraically equivalent to,
                \[ 3^{n-k} \cdot \binom{n}{k}  = \sum_{m=k}^{n} 2^{n-m} \binom{n}{m} \binom{m}{k}  \]
                So it remains to show that the above is true. We shall prove this using a double couting argument. Suppose we 
                are given \(n\) balls \(1,2...n\) and we want to color them using four colors: red, blue, yellow, and green.
                We also impose the constraint that exactly \(k\) of the balls are red. Let \(N_k\) be the number 
                of unique ways to do this. We will prove the claim by showing both sides o the above are equal to \(N_k \). <br><br>

                First, observe \(N_k = 3^{n-k} \cdot \binom{n}{k}\). Why is this? Recall we want to color \(k\) balls red and the other balls 
                any of blue, yellow, and green. There are \(\binom{n}{k}\) choices for the \(k\) red balls and, for each choice, 
                \(3^{n-k}\) ways to color the others blue, yellow, and green. And thus, multiplying these, \(N_k = 3^{n-k} \cdot \binom{n}{k}\). <br><br>

                We are left to show that \( N_k = \sum_{m=k}^{n} 2^{n-m} \binom{n}{m} \binom{m}{k} \). Now, we count the number of ways 
                to achieve our coloring like so. First, consider any \(k \leq m \leq n\). Now pick any \( m \) balls to color red or blue, of which there are 
                \( \binom{n}{m} \) ways to do so. Now, of the \(m\) balls you have, pick \(k\) balls to color red and color the other 
                \(m-k\) blue - there are \(\binom{m}{k}\) possibilities. Finally, color the other \(n-m\) balls yellow or green - there are 
                \(2^{n-m}\) ways to do this. Thus, for a given \(m\), there are \(2^{n-m} \binom{n}{m} \binom{m}{k} \) ways to accomplish 
                this coloring with. Summing over all possible \(m\)s, we at last have that there are \(N_K = \sum_{m=k}^{n} 2^{n-m} \binom{n}{m} \binom{m}{k}\) ways 
                to color the balls as described. This concludes the proof.

                Binomial Fact 2. 
            </div>
            <div class = 'statement'>
                The following holds for all \( n \geq 0\),
                \[ \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{(-1)^k}{k}\binom{n}{k} = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} \]
            </div>
            <div class = 'proof'>
                Proof:<br><br>

                For this proof, we will combine calculus along with the binomial theorem. Consider the following 
                integral: 

                \[ I = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{y}((1-y)^n - 1)dy \]

                What is the value of \(I\)? Let us first expand the exponential term using the binomial formula: 

                \[ I = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{y}\bigg(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} (-y)^k \bigg - 1)=\int_0^1 \frac{1}{y}  \sum_{k=1}^n  \binom{n}{k} (-y)^k \] 
                \[ = \int_0^1  \sum_{k=1}^n  \binom{n}{k} (-1) (-y)^{k-1} = - \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k} \int_0^1 (-y)^{k-1} = \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k} \frac{1}{k} \bigg((-1)^{k} - (0)^k \bigg) \]

                So all in all, 

                \[ I = \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k} \frac{(-1)^k}{k} \]

                On the other hand, we can calculate \(I\) through a change of variables. Note, letting \(u = 1-y, du = - dy\)

                \[ I = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{y}((1-y)^n - 1)dy = \int_0^1 \frac{1- u^n}{1-u}du \]

                This can be recognized as a finitee geometric series. Swapping the integral with the sum, 
                evaluating, and reindexing, we find:

                \[ = \int_0^1 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} u^k du = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \int_0^1 u^k du  = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{k+1} =  \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} \]

                And thus, 

                \[ \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} = I = \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k} \frac{(-1)^k}{k}  \]

                Which concludes the proof!
