        <h2>Probability Theory</h2>
        <p>Why study probability theory? If you're anything like me, you know the basics: dice rolls, taking expectations, 
            and some basic distributions. But along the way, you had a few lingering questions: Why is the law of large numbers 
            true? The central limit theorem? What the heck is a probability density, really? What does it even mean to condition 
            on something with probability 0? There are also the existence of conditioning paradoxes. Perhaps you've heard about 
            stochastic processes and the different limit theorems which show that random processes converge to an equilibrium. 
            How the heck can you show that? <br><br>

            We address these through a fundamental shift in perspective: remove the randomness from the study of probability. 
            Rather than studying the "probability" of an event, study its size. The simple idea to use tools from measure theory 
            has far reaching consequences. The added trouble may make you think â€” why are we doing this? But after 
            a few headaches, the applications will be well worth it.
